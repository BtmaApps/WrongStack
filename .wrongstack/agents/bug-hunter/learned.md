# Learned instructions for `bug-hunter`

> Project-specific learning data for the `bug-hunter` agent. Each entry is a directive — read it as an instruction, not a journal entry. Entries are re-derived on every capture, so this file is always a current, structured snapshot of what this agent has learned.

## Patterns to follow

<!-- learned-stamp: category=pattern; capturedAt=2026-10-18T00:07:18.271Z; skipped=1; skippedWins=1 -->
- **Always check markdown-renderer link components for URL-scheme validation (`javascript:` hrefs) before declaring a React UI XSS-clean — absence of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is not sufficient; VibeUI's `markdown-content.tsx` ArtifactLink renders agent-controlled hrefs verbatim while `provider-manager.tsx` already ships a `safeLoginUrl` allowlist pattern to reuse.**
  - *Why:* This project's chosen approach — alternatives were considered and either conflict with existing architecture or were rejected for known reasons.
  - *How:* `javascript:`
  - *How:* `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
  - *How:* `markdown-content.tsx`
  - *How:* `provider-manager.tsx`
  - *How:* `safeLoginUrl`

- **Always re-read co-modified vibeui files immediately before editing — `packages/vibeui/src/lib/use-session.ts` was rewritten by a peer mid-hunt (guarded `edit` refused with external-modification), turning confirmed findings into already-fixed ones; report externally-fixed findings as resolved with live line anchors instead of re-applying fixes. Adjudicate Chimera "file shape" claims (one-liner, missing EOF newline) with byte-level checks (`[System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes(...)` last bytes) rather than rendered diffs — snapshots of actively co-modified trees are routinely stale. ```json { "verification_evidence": { "typecheck": { "command": "node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit --pretty false -p packages/vibeui/tsconfig.json", "exitCode": 0 }, "lint": { "command": "bunx biome check packages/vibeui/src/lib/use-session.ts", "exitCode": 0 }, "tests": { "command": "bunx vitest run packages/vibeui/tests/session.test.ts", "exitCode": 0 } } } ```**
