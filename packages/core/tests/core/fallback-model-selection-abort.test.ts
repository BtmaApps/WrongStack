/**
 * Regression: an ABORTED run must never be reported as a capacity fault.
 *
 * `ensureUsableModelResponse` sees "no usable blocks" for two very different
 * situations — a genuinely empty provider response, and a stream that was cut
 * short by cancellation. It used to report both as `kind:'overloaded'`, which
 * IS fallback-eligible, so a session being torn down rotated through every
 * configured model instead of stopping.
 *
 * Observed live on 2026-10-05: the tech-stack audit's first call was cancelled by
 * leader teardown and the chain logged "Empty response from
 * zai-coding-plan/glm-5.3; trying the next configured model".
 *
 * This mirrors the four `ctx_.signal?.aborted` checks already in
 * `runFallbackChain` — same root shape, different branch (the success path rather
 * than the throw path).
