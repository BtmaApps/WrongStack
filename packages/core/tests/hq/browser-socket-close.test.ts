/**
 * Which browser sockets an auth change must close.
 *
 * The HQ server binds every open browser socket to the session that authorized
 * it, then closes only the sockets whose OWN session died. Before that binding
 * existed, any revocation closed EVERY browser — so revoking one operator's
 * token logged out every other operator too.
 *
 * The predicate is deliberately asymmetric: a socket with no recorded session
 * authenticated with a bare `?token=` rather than a cookie session, so it can
 * never be proven safe and is closed. Failing closed here reproduces the
 * pre-binding behaviour exactly, which is the right direction for a predicate
 * that decides whether to drop an authenticated connection.
