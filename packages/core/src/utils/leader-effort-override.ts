/**
 * The leader's own reasoning-effort override (`leader_effort_set`).
 *
 * The leader may raise or lower its OWN effort mid-session when the work
 * changes shape — deep debugging wants more thinking than a run of mechanical
 * edits. That is a statement the leader makes, and it must never outrank the
 * user: whatever the user picks afterwards, on any surface, wins.
 *
 * So the override is NOT written into the user's own fields
 * (`Config.modelRuntime.reasoning.effort`, or the conversation's
 * `reasoningEffort` pref). It lives in its own conversation-meta record that
 * remembers what the user's two settings were when the leader spoke. It stays
 * in force only while both are still exactly that; the moment the user changes
 * either one (`/effort`, Settings, the WebUI composer select), the record goes
 * dormant and the user's choice applies — with no extra wiring in any of those
 * paths.
 *
 * Leaf module: imported by the request middleware (`model-runtime.ts`) and by
 * the tool, so neither has to reach into the other.
