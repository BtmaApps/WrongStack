/**
 * Request middleware that puts a skill suggestion in front of the turn.
 *
 * The suggestion is appended as a VOLATILE system block after the roster, not
 * folded into it. The roster text stays byte-identical across turns, which is
 * what keeps the provider's cached prefix intact; `markVolatileSystemBlock`
 * tells wires without explicit cache breakpoints (OpenAI Responses / Codex,
 * which flatten every system block into one `instructions` string) to relocate
 * this block rather than let it invalidate that prefix.
 *
 * ## Why this caches per user message
 *
 * The request pipeline runs on EVERY provider call, tool-loop iterations
 * included — a single user turn can be a dozen calls. The suggestion is a
 * judgment about the USER'S REQUEST, and that does not change between
 * iterations, so calling TypeSafe on each one would multiply both the cost and
 * the added latency by the length of the turn for an identical answer. The
 * result is computed once per distinct user message and replayed for the rest
 * of the turn, which also keeps the block's text stable while the turn runs.
 *
 * ## What leaves the machine
 *
 * The latest user message text, and the roster's skill names plus their
 * one-line triggers (and, for the three shortlisted candidates, the opening of
 * their bodies). This is why the feature is OFF by default and why its config
 * subtree is stripped from in-project config: a repo-committed `endpoint`
 * would otherwise redirect every prompt this agent sees to a host the repo
 * chose.

/**
 * The block appended after the roster.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices, both load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. It says the suggestion can be ignored. Pushing harder wins compliance on
 *    the WRONG suggestions too, and a wrong suggestion is worse than none —
 *    a confident pointer is more persuasive than silence.
 * 2. A turn with nothing to suggest still says so, rather than emitting no
 *    block. The skill manifest carries a standing "load a skill when one is
 *    relevant" instruction; sending nothing would leave that unopposed on
 *    exactly the turns where the gate decided nothing applies.
 *
 * `name` is always a roster entry — the suggester only returns names it sent
 * as Choice options and re-validated on the way back — so nothing
 * model-authored is interpolated here.
