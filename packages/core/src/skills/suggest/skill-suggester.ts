/**
 * Two-pass skill suggestion over the discovered skill roster.
 *
 * The agent chooses a skill from a manifest that gives it one line per skill
 * (`buildProgressiveSkillManifestText`). At a few dozen skills that line is all
 * it has to tell `design-craft` from `design-critique`, or `code-review` from
 * `auto-review` — names that are genuinely close, whose one-liners are closer
 * still. It also has a standing instruction to load a skill when one is
 * relevant, which invites a guess on turns where nothing is.
 *
 * This module puts two cheap judgments in front of that decision, following
 * TypeSafe's published skill-suggestion recipe:
 *
 *   Pass 1 — read the whole roster cheaply. One `Choice` over every skill name
 *     (criteria = the same trigger line the agent sees) ranks them, and three
 *     `Noul` questions ask, three different ways, whether this turn wants a
 *     documented procedure at all. Their mean is the gate.
 *   Pass 2 — read the shortlist properly. A `Choice` over the top N, now with
 *     each skill's full description and the opening of its body, plus one
 *     `Noul` per candidate asking whether it does the specific thing asked for.
 *     Every one of those can come back low, which is how the whole shortlist
 *     gets rejected.
 *
 * Either pass may return nothing, and returning nothing is a normal outcome —
 * roughly a third of turns in TypeSafe's own evaluation. The result is a
 * SUGGESTION: it is rendered as one line the model is explicitly told it may
 * ignore, because a confident wrong suggestion is worse than no suggestion,
 * and the model still has the full manifest and its own judgment.
 *
 * The thresholds here are TypeSafe's published starting points, not tuned
 * against this roster. They are config-exposed for exactly that reason — see
 * `docs/skills-suggestion.md` for how to evaluate them on real turns.
