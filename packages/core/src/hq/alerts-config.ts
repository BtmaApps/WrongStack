/**
 * HQ alerts-config persistence — `<dataDir>/alerts-config.json`.
 *
 * W2 #13 (RFC hq-improvements-2026-09.md): operator-configurable alert
 * thresholds and per-rule snoozes survive HQ server restarts. Lives in its
 * own JSON file (not appended to `alerts.jsonl`, which is the audit trail)
 * because:
 *
 *   - The audit trail is immutable history; snoozes are mutable operator
 *     state. Mixing them would require in-place rewrites of an append-only
 *     log, which we deliberately don't do.
 *   - Snooze writes are rare (operator action) but happen mid-session;
 *     atomic-replace semantics are right for them. JSONL append is for the
 *     fires-and-history stream, not for current state.
 *
 * Same design constraints as {@link module:hq/auth-store}:
 *   - Reads fail CLOSED with one exception: ENOENT returns an empty file
 *     (fresh install / first boot).
 *   - All writes go through {@link atomicWrite} with `mode: 0o600` and the
 *     Windows-hardened path, so a shared host cannot read the snooze state.
 *   - Read-modify-write cycles use {@link mutateHqAlertsConfig} which takes
 *     a {@link withFileLock} under the hood. The 2026-08-25 deferred
 *     heartbeat (1 s floor) is inherited automatically — callers MUST NOT
 *     add their own lock or setTimeout deferral.
 *   - Best-effort on disk failure; degradation to in-memory-only is
 *     acceptable. Callers wrap in try/catch and log on failure.
