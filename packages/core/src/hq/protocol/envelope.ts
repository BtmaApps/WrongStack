 * HQ protocol envelope primitives — dependency leaf.

 * This module is intentionally free of imports from any other HQ protocol
 * module so that the shared envelope/version contracts can be consumed by
 * every domain module (`core`, `client`, `session`, `fleet`, `resume`, …)
 * without creating a module cycle back through `core.ts`.
 *
 * `core.ts` re-exports these symbols for backward compatibility; new modules
 * that only need the envelope shape should import from here directly.

   * bridge considers the unit of work — a Brain decision request id, a fleet

   * older publishers need no change and consumers must not require it.
