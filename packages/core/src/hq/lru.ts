/**
 * W3 #17 (RFC hq-improvements-2026-09.md): bounded LRU for tracked agents.
 *
 * A generic, allocation-bounded LRU map used by the HQ session bridge to
 * cap the working set of `TrackedAgentSnapshot` references. The motivation
 * is a regression surfaced by the SAGE memory:
 *
 *   "`startSessionTelemetryBridge()` in `packages/core/src/hq/session-bridge.ts`
 *    allocates `Buffer.allocUnsafe(stat.size - offset)` and reads the
 *    entire outstanding JSONL delta in one operation. A 64 MiB synthetic
 *    delta caused a 64 MiB external-memory increase in the evidence run;
 *    cap each read/chunk to bound burst memory while preserving byte-offset
 *    tailing."
 *
 * The LRU is the structural fix for that regression on the agent-tracking
 * side: by capping the working set per `(clientId, sessionId)`, we bound
 * the memory footprint of the snapshot bridge itself.
 *
 * Design constraints (mirrors the RFC + SAGE):
 *
 *   - O(1) get/set/evict via a `Map` insertion-order traversal (Map iteration
 *     is guaranteed in insertion order by the JS spec, so we don't need a
 *     doubly-linked list).
 *   - Generic key/value; the session bridge scopes its LRU per
 *     `(clientId, sessionId)` so eviction is local and predictable.
 *   - **CRITICAL INVARIANT** (from RFC): the LRU bounds the WORKING SET,
 *     not the FRESHNESS FLOOR. Session-bridge's 4-min keepalive must stay
 *     below HQ's 5-min stale-eviction window. The LRU's `evictIfStale()`
 *     method only evicts entries whose `lastTouchedAt + freshnessFloorMs
 *     < now` — so the freshness floor is honored even if access recency
 *     would otherwise evict.
 *   - Best-effort: the LRU never throws on bounds violation. `set()` past
 *     the cap evicts the oldest eligible entry; if no eligible entry
 *     exists (all are within the freshness floor), the new entry is
 *     refused and `set()` returns false so the caller can log it.
 *
