/**
 * W4 #15 (RFC hq-improvements-2026-09.md) — browser-token revocation detection.
 *
 * The HQ server live-reloads `auth.json` through {@link module:hq/auth-store}'s
 * watcher, so revoking a token takes effect on the *next* request that
 * presents it. A browser already holding an authenticated session never makes
 * that request — it sits on an open WebSocket — so a revoked operator kept a
 * working dashboard until the 30-minute idle eviction happened to catch it.
 *
 * Detecting the revocation is pure set arithmetic, deliberately kept free of
 * I/O and WebSocket knowledge so it can be tested exhaustively and reused by
 * any surface that needs to react. Deciding what to *do* about it (broadcast a
 * frame, close a socket) belongs to the caller.
 *
 * @module hq/auth-revocation
 */

/**
 * Token keys that were live before and are not live now — i.e. the operator
 * revoked them.
 *
 * Keyed on the stored verifier (`hqTokenKey`), which is what every live-token
 * set in HQ is keyed on, so a legacy cleartext file and a hashed one produce
 * the same answer for the same token.
 *
 * Expiry is NOT revocation-by-another-name here: an expired token is already
 * filtered out of both sets by the projection, so a token that simply aged out
 * also shows up as "revoked". That is the intended behaviour — from the open
 * socket's point of view the two are indistinguishable, and in both cases the
 * browser must re-authenticate.
 *
 * Order follows `previous`'s iteration order, so the result is stable for a
 * given pair of sets rather than dependent on hash seeding.
