 * `.claude` earns its place the same way `.wrongstack` did: it is the tool's own
 * workspace, not the user's project, so nothing inside it is an "external
 * mutation" worth an audit event. It matters far more than it looks — git
 * worktrees live under `.claude/worktrees`, and a worktree is a full copy of the
 * repository. Creating one made the watcher report every tracked file as
 * `file.external.created`, and removing it reported every file again as
 * `deleted`. Measured on this repo: 85,619 of 85,813 file events in a single
 * day came from `.claude/worktrees`, ~95 MB of a 106 MB journal — 90% of the
 * day's telemetry describing the tool watching itself.
