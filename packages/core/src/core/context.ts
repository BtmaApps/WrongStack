 * parameter — pass `ctx` for it. Existing tools that accept `Context`
 * still work because `Context` structurally satisfies both.
 *
 * The single source of truth for the project directory is `projectRoot`.
 * All tools (read/write/bash/exec) resolve paths relative to this.
 * Sessions, config, memory, and logs are also stored under this root.
 *
 * There IS a mutable `workingDir` (separate from `projectRoot`) that can be
 * changed at runtime via `setWorkingDir()`. It starts as `cwd` and allows
 * the agent and user to navigate within the project without spawning a new
 * process. In restricted mode it stays inside `projectRoot` or the user-global
