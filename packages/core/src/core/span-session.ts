 * under the leader's — instead of reporting every span as a trace of its own.
 *
 * `session.id` is the session a surface is showing. A subagent runs under its
 * own journal, so it also carries `agent.session.id`, which the leader's spans
 * never do. Missing ids (stub contexts, a run with no session yet) just leave
 * the attribute out.
