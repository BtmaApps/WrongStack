/**
 * Continue-intent detection + continuation resolution.
 *
 * ## Problem
 *
 * Users frequently type a bare "continue" (or "devam", "go on", "keep going")
 * to nudge the agent forward without supplying any new instruction. On its own
 * that word carries no information about *what* to continue — the model has to
 * re-derive "what was next" from history, which drifts as the context window is
 * compacted. Left unanchored, a run of "continue … continue … continue" turns
 * into an ever-vaguer manual loop: the model repeats work, declares completion
 * prematurely, or wanders.
 *
 * ## Approach
 *
 * A bare "continue" is not new information — it points at an *existing* goal.
 * So instead of asking the model to remember a hidden per-message marker, we
 * resolve the continuation against the state we already keep:
 *
 *   1. **Open todos** — the strongest, most durable anchor. Survives context
 *      compaction (todos are re-injected each turn) and goal.json persistence.
 *      "continue" = resume the next open todo.
 *   2. **Parsed `<nextsteps>` suggestions** — the menu surfaced after the last
 *      completed turn (already extracted and stored by the surface's
 *      suggestion store). "continue" = do suggestion #1.
 *   3. **Open continuation** — no explicit task is queued, but the user still
 *      wants work to proceed. We inject an instruction that tells the model to
 *      pick the single most valuable next step itself and carry it out — while
 *      explicitly forbidding fabricated busywork. This is what keeps "continue"
 *      from ever dead-ending.
 *
 * This module is pure and surface-agnostic: detection takes the raw string,
 * resolution takes already-collected data (todos + parsed suggestion strings).
 * The REPL and TUI wire it in at the point where a user message becomes an
 * agent run, *before* prompt refinement — a bare "continue" has nothing
 * meaningful to refine, and refining it would only add latency and drift.
 *
 * The three triggers of the same continuation machinery — the user typing
 * "continue", the model emitting the `[continue]` marker (see
 * {@link parseContinueDirective}), and an autonomy tick — all ultimately want
 * the same thing: advance the plan. This module is the manual-trigger path.
