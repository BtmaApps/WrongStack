/**
 * Refuse to boot when the resolved project root lives inside
 * `<globalRoot>/projects` — the per-project state namespace WrongStack itself
 * owns (`~/.wrongstack/projects/<slug>`, or under `WRONGSTACK_HOME`).
 *
 * When this happens it means a caller spawned a WrongStack process with a
 * state path as its cwd; `DefaultPathResolver` then finds no project marker,
 * walks up, hits the home-directory stop, and falls back to cwd — so the state
 * directory itself becomes the "project". Boot would go on to register a
 * nested slug (`<slug>-<hash>`) with its own `meta.json`, `projects.json`
 * entry, mailbox lock and token, splitting coordination state across two
 * namespaces — with the nested one always winning `lastSeen`.
 *
 * Deliberately scoped to `projects/` rather than all of `globalRoot`: a user
 * may legitimately point `WRONGSTACK_HOME` at a directory that also contains
 * real repositories (our own bridge tests do exactly this), and refusing those
 * would be a false positive. Nothing under `projects/` is ever a real repo, so
 * the narrow check has no such ambiguity.
 *
 * Loud on purpose — the symptom is far harder to diagnose than a refused boot
 * that names the offending directory.

/**
 * Remove project directories that can no longer describe a real project:
 * those whose original `root` is gone from disk (temp dirs from tests,

 * back inside the state namespace.
 *
 * The nested case is the residue of the bug `assertProjectRootOutsideStateDir`
 * now refuses at boot: a process started with a state path as its cwd
 * registered `<slug>-<hash>` whose `root` is `<globalRoot>/projects/<slug>`.
 * The guard stops new ones, but it cannot retire the ones already on disk —
 * and the existing "root is gone" rule never matches them, because their root
 * is a directory that very much still exists. They therefore persisted
 * indefinitely, each one doubling a real project's footprint: its own
 * `meta.json`, mailbox lock, token, and — because callers enumerate this
 * directory — its own spawned daemon.
 *
 * Safe to delete unconditionally: nothing under `projects/` is ever a real
 * repository, which is the same reasoning that lets the boot guard scope
 * itself to that subtree.
 *
 * Runs as a fire-and-forget best-effort — failures are silently ignored.
 *
 * @internal Exported for tests: this recursively deletes directories, so its
 * keep/delete decision is worth pinning directly rather than through `boot()`.
