/**
 * YOLO+ for a subagent follows the conversation that spawned it.
 *
 * A leader reads YOLO and YOLO+ from its own conversation's `ctx.meta` (one
 * WebUI tab, one meta). Subagents live in ONE process-wide fleet host shared by
 * every tab, so a subagent cannot read "the" meta — it has to find its own
 * tab's. A host that keeps several conversations registers how to find a
 * conversation's leader meta by session id; a subagent then answers with the
 * leader policy's own rule (`yoloModeFor`) on that meta, so one tab's YOLO+
 * never widens another tab's workers. A host with one conversation registers
 * nothing and the caller's fallback (the live config) answers, as before.
 *
 * The resolver sits on `globalThis` under a `Symbol.for` key: the fleet host
 * and the WebUI host can be bundled separately, and a module-level variable
 * would give each bundle its own empty copy.
