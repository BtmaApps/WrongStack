/**
 * Stop asking a host that has told us the credential is no good.
 *
 * The client deliberately does not retry a 401/403 — those fail identically on
 * every attempt. But "do not retry" is per-request, and the features here run
 * per turn: a key that was revoked yesterday buys a rejected request, and its
 * latency, on every turn from now on, and nothing says so out loud. The
 * failure is invisible precisely because every consumer is built to degrade
 * silently.
 *
 * This wraps a client and counts CONSECUTIVE authentication rejections. After
 * `threshold` of them it opens for the rest of the process and every later
 * call fails immediately without touching the network, having told the host
 * once why.
 *
 * What it deliberately does NOT trip on:
 *
 *   429 / 529   transient by the service's own documentation — the backoff in
 *               the client is the right answer, and disabling a feature over
 *               load would turn a busy minute into a lost session.
 *   network 0   a laptop that closed its lid is not a revoked key.
 *   422         a bad question is our bug, not a credential problem; it
 *               deserves to keep failing loudly rather than silently disable
 *               an unrelated feature.
 *
 * One success resets the count, so a key rotated mid-session recovers without
 * a restart.
