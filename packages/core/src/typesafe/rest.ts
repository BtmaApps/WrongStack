/**
 * Let a busy or unreachable TypeSafe host rest.
 *
 * The auth breaker (`breaker.ts`) answers "will this credential ever work?"
 * and deliberately ignores load: a 429 is not a revoked key. That leaves the
 * other half unanswered. A host that is rate-limiting us, returning 5xx, or
 * not answering at all still gets asked on every turn by every feature — each
 * ask paying the client's retry-with-backoff and its timeout before the caller
 * takes its fallback path. With several judgment features wired to the same
 * account, one bad minute at the provider turns into seconds of added latency
 * on every turn, spent confirming what the previous turn already learned.
 *
 * This gate records transient failures and, once they say the host is not
 * answering, makes every caller skip the network for a cooldown. Callers see
 * {@link TypeSafeRestingError} immediately and take the path they would have
 * taken after a timeout — without the timeout. After the cooldown the next
 * call is let through as a probe: success closes the gate, another failure
 * reopens it for twice as long, capped.
 *
 * ## Shared, not per client
 *
 * Rate limits are per account, and a host that is down is down for everyone.
 * The gate is therefore shared by every client that talks to the same
 * endpoint with the same credential ({@link sharedTypeSafeRestGate}), so the
 * skill suggester learning the host is saturated spares the Brain the same
 * lesson. Tests inject their own gate.
 *
 * ## What counts
 *
 *   status 0     network error / timeout — counts
 *   408, 5xx     counts
 *   429, 529     counts double: the service said "slow down" in so many words
 *   401/403/422  never — those are the credential or our question, and the
 *                auth breaker / the caller own them
 *   abort        never — the caller cancelled, the host did nothing wrong
