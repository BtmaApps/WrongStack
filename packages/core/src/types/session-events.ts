/**
 * SessionEvent — per-session persistent JSONL audit + reconstruct log.
 *
 * ## Two-Tier Model (see Config.session.auditLevel)
 *
 * **Core Reconstruct Set** (always persisted, minimal & reliable):
 * - `session_start`, `session_resumed`, `session_forked`, `user_input`, `llm_response`, `tool_result`
 * - `message_appended`, `message_updated`, `messages_replaced` (exact conversation journal)
 * - `context_snapshot`, `checkpoint`, `file_snapshot`, `file_observation`, `rewound`
 * - `in_flight_start` / `in_flight_end`, `session_end`
 *
 * These events are **required** for correct resume, rewind, crash recovery
 * and conversation replay. They are written regardless of auditLevel.
 *
 * **Audit Detail Set** (controlled by `session.auditLevel`):
 * - `llm_request` (lightweight by default)
 * - `tool_use`, `tool_call_start`/`tool_call_end`
 * - `compaction`, `error`, `message_truncated`, provider retries, etc.
 *
 * When `auditLevel: "minimal"` only Core Reconstruct events are guaranteed.
 * `"standard"` (default) adds the most valuable lightweight audit events.
 * `"full"` enables heavier payloads (may be stored in a sidecar replay log).
 *
 * ## Guarantees
 * - All appends are best-effort. A failed write logs a throttled warning but
 *   never aborts the agent loop.
 * - Sensitive content in `user_input`, `llm_response`, and
 *   `context_snapshot` is passed through the configured SecretScrubber before
 *   being written or summarized.
 * - The log is append-only JSONL. Individual lines may be malformed after
 *   hard crashes; `DefaultSessionStore.load()` silently skips bad lines.
 *
 * ## Location (source of truth: resolveWstackPaths)
 * ~/.wrongstack/projects/<sha256(projectRoot).slice(0,12)>/sessions/<date>/sess_<ULID>.jsonl
 *
 * The only files that live inside the project tree are the committed
 * `.wrongstack/AGENTS.md` and `.wrongstack/skills/`.

/**
 * Attribution stamped onto a journal event by the WRITER, never by the

 *
 * A leader's JSONL can carry events produced by its subagents: the

 * subagent's appends into the leader's journal because that subagent has no
 * journal of its own. Without a stamp those appends are indistinguishable
 * from the leader's, so a transcript reader cannot say which agent ran which
 * tool. `withAgentAttribution` sets this at the writer boundary — the one
 * place that knows whose writer it is — so no emit site has to remember.

 * which reads the same way and is correct: they predate subagent interleaving
