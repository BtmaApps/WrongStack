 *   leaving this mode by adding a `brain.rules` entry matching
 *   `source: 'system'` with `offersOption: 'steer'` — the rule tier runs in
 *   front of everything that costs tokens.
 * - `steer` — always intervene, no Brain call at all.
 * - `observe` — never intervene; only emit `brain.intervention` for the
 *   surfaces. Useful to measure how often signals fire before acting on them.
