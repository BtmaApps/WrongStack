/**
 * Which tools a conversation can actually call — the one answer every
 * consumer reads.
 *
 * `ctx.tools` is the surface sent to the provider (resolved per conversation
 * from its identity variant and tier). `ctx.catalogTools` is everything
 * registered. A tool outside the surface is still reachable when, and only
 * when, the surface carries `tool_use`, the gateway that calls withheld tools.
 * So:
 *
 * - Scout and the token-saving tiers send `tool_use`: the whole catalog is
 *   reachable, most of it through the gateway.
 * - Quick sends a fixed basic set plus the two gateway schemas: the catalog is
 *   reachable on demand without its schemas entering the context.
 * - A surface without `tool_use` (a host that pins one) reaches exactly itself.
 * - A context with no declared surface (`ctx.tools` empty) is unrestricted.
 *
 * The executor enforces this, the unknown-tool message lists it, and the tool
 * coach and the WrongForge gateway offer from it. Before it existed each of
 * them read the registry directly and could disagree about what a session
 * was able to call.
