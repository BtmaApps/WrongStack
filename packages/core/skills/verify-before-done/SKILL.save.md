# Verify Before Done (Compact)

<!-- source-version: 1.2.1 -->

## Selection card
- Task: Prove a claimed fix or completion actually works. / TR: Düzeltme veya tamamlanma iddiasını çalıştırarak kanıtla.
- Start: Identify the scope and obtain an executable before-proof or review evidence.
- Finish: apply the acceptance checks below; report observed results and unresolved constraints.

## Overview

"Done" is a claim the user acts on: they merge, deploy, or stop looking. This
skill makes the claim evidence-based — the change does what was asked, nothing
adjacent broke, and the report says precisely what was checked. It costs
minutes; a false "done" costs the user's trust and often an incident.

## Rules

1. Re-read the request and check the change against every part of it, including
   the easy-to-forget parts: docs, config, migrations, other platforms.
2. Review your own diff before reporting — unintended edits, leftover debug
   code, commented-out code, new TODOs, secrets, files from unrelated work.
3. Run the checks that apply, cheapest first: format and lint, type check,
   targeted tests, the suites for touched packages, build. Use the project's own
   commands from package scripts, Makefile, or CI config.
4. Exercise the behaviour itself when no test covers it: run the command, call
   the endpoint, open the page. A passing unrelated suite is not evidence.
5. Read results instead of trusting exit codes. Zero tests run, skipped suites,
   disabled checks, and cached results are not passes.
6. Fix failures you caused. Show pre-existing failures are pre-existing (they
   fail on the base too) and report them; never weaken a check to get green.
7. Report faithfully: what ran and its outcome, what couldn't be verified and
   why, and known gaps. Never write "should work" in place of checking, and
   never claim a check that didn't run.
8. Lead with an honest outcome. A change whose related checks failed, timed
   out, or didn't run is "done, verification incomplete" — never "done". When
   the task defines outcome labels, use them exactly.

## Detailed workflow

Load the full verify-before-done skill before relying on its specialized modes,
references or output contracts. Its current SKILL.md is the source of truth;
this compact body does not expand task scope or authorization.

## Before returning

- [ ] Outcome stated first, and "incomplete" wherever any check failed or didn't run
- [ ] Every requested outcome maps to evidence
- [ ] Own diff reviewed; nothing unrelated or left over; others' edits untouched
- [ ] Temporary artifacts you created removed, or their path reported
- [ ] Applicable checks run with the project's commands, results read
- [ ] Behaviour exercised directly where tests don't cover it
- [ ] Report separates verified, not verified, and pre-existing issues
