# Prompt Engineering (Compact)

<!-- source-version: 2.1.1 -->

## Selection card
- Task: Design grounded instructions and output contracts. / TR: Kaynağa dayalı yönerge ve çıktı sözleşmesi tasarla.
- Start: Identify the requested artifact, repository owner and acceptance criteria.
- Finish: apply the acceptance checks below; report observed results and unresolved constraints.

## Overview

Current models follow instructions closely, so most prompt failures are
failures of clarity, not of emphasis: a missing reason, a buried or
contradictory rule, an example that teaches the wrong thing, or a tool whose
purpose overlaps another. Write prompts the way you would brief a capable new
colleague who has none of your context, then check them against real inputs.

## Rules

1. State the goal and the reason. A rule with its "why" generalizes to cases
   the rule didn't list; a bare rule gets applied literally.
2. Say what good output looks like — format, length, audience, and when the
   task is done. Prefer "do X" over a list of things not to do.
3. Use examples deliberately. They are copied closely, so make them varied,
   representative, and consistent with the written rules.
4. Structure long prompts. Separate instructions, context, and data with
   headings or XML-style tags; put long reference material before the question
   that uses it.
5. Calibrate emphasis. Capitals and "CRITICAL" on every line make a model
   over-apply rules to cases they were never meant for; reserve strong wording
   for genuine hard constraints.
6. Remove filler and resolve contradictions. Every sentence should change
   behaviour; when two instructions can conflict, state which wins.
7. Order for caching: stable content (identity, tools, standing rules) first,
   volatile content (session state, recent errors) last.
8. Test against a fixed set of inputs, including edge cases and inputs the
   prompt should decline. Change one thing at a time and read the outputs, not
   just a score.

## Detailed workflow

Load the full prompt-engineering skill before relying on its specialized modes,
references or output contracts. Its current SKILL.md is the source of truth;
this compact body does not expand task scope or authorization.
