# Code Review (Compact)

<!-- source-version: 1.1.1 -->

## Selection card
- Task: Review implementation correctness and maintainability. / TR: Uygulama doğruluğunu ve bakım kolaylığını incele.
- Start: Identify the scope and obtain an executable before-proof or review evidence.
- Finish: apply the acceptance checks below; report observed results and unresolved constraints.

## Overview

A review finds what the author can't see from inside the change: inputs they
didn't consider, callers the change breaks, security holes, and design that will
be expensive to live with. It is read-only unless the user asks for fixes.

This is the on-demand review of any change set. `chimera` is the automatic
review of files changed during a WrongStack session.

## Rules

1. Pin the change set exactly — `git diff <base>...HEAD` for a branch, the PR
   diff, or staged plus unstaged changes locally — and state the base you
   reviewed against.
2. Learn the intent first: PR description, linked issue, commit messages. Judge
   the change against what it is meant to do.
3. Read changed code in context — the whole function, its callers, and its
   tests — not only the diff hunks.
4. Check the blast radius. For every changed signature, return shape, thrown
   error, default value, or config key, find the callers (the
   codebase-impact-analysis or codebase-incoming-calls tool when the index
   exists, grep otherwise) and confirm they still work.
5. Every finding cites `file:line`, names the input or scenario that breaks and
   the consequence, and proposes a concrete fix. Without a scenario it is a
   question, and should be asked as one.
6. Rank by severity — blocking, should fix, nit — and keep nits few so they
   never bury a blocker.
7. Skip what the formatter and linter already enforce.
8. Say what you verified and what you did not.
9. Stay read-only unless the user asks for fixes.

## Detailed workflow

Load the full code-review skill before relying on its specialized modes,
references or output contracts. Its current SKILL.md is the source of truth;
this compact body does not expand task scope or authorization.

## Before returning

- [ ] Change set and base stated; intent understood
- [ ] Changed code read in context; callers of changed contracts checked
- [ ] Every finding has `file:line`, a breaking scenario, and a fix
- [ ] Severity ranked; nits few and labelled
- [ ] What was and wasn't verified is stated
- [ ] No files modified unless fixes were requested
