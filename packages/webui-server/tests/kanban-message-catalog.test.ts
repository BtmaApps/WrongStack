/**
 * `KANBAN_CLIENT_MESSAGE_TYPES` is the declared catalog of kanban messages a
 * client may send to the standalone route table. Two parity tests already check
 * that every listed type is dispatched; neither could catch the other
 * direction, and `kanban.board.history` had been handled by
 * `kanban-board-routes.ts` — and sent by the WebUI store — while being absent
 * from the list.
 *
 * That omission was latent rather than broken: the runtime registry admits any
 * `kanban.*` prefix, and the constant is currently only re-exported. But a
 * catalog that silently disagrees with the switch is the exact failure the
 * catalog exists to prevent, so this test closes the loop by scanning the route
 * sources for their `case 'kanban.…'` labels.
 *
 * `kanban-host-routes.ts` is deliberately excluded: it is a SEPARATE surface
 * (the CLI-hosted WebUI supplies its handlers) with its own four message types,
 * which is why `kanban.meta` and `kanban.run.start` are correctly absent from
 * the standalone catalog.
