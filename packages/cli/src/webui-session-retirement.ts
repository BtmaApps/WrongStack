   * Retire the runtime of a tab that was closed.
   *
   * A closed tab used to leave everything behind: its Agent, that agent's
   * whole in-memory transcript, and an OPEN journal writer with a live file
   * handle. Nothing ever asked for them again, and the next session to need a
   * slot evicted a tab the user still had open instead.
   *
   * Two refusals, both deliberate:
   *   - a session with a live run keeps its agent, because the run outlives
   *     the tab that started it and still needs somewhere to write;
   *   - the boot session keeps its agent, because that agent IS the leader
   *     the whole host is wired to.
