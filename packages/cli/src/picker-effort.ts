/**
 * Reasoning-effort strip for the STARTUP model picker — the pre-TUI twin of
 * the `/model` picker's ←/→ strip (tui/components/model-picker-effort.ts).
 *
 * The vocabulary is model-aware the same way: a model whose catalog entry
 * documents its levels offers only those, an undocumented reasoner offers the
 * full canonical set (the runtime resolver drops what the wire cannot carry),
 * and a non-reasoning model — or one documented as having no effort control —
 * offers nothing. The list is always led by {@link EFFORT_KEEP}, so pressing
 * Enter without touching ←/→ keeps the configured effort exactly as before.
