/**
 * Regression for S7 (RACE-002 / G5): the previous `withFileLock` wrote
 * `${pid}:${mtime}` and the `finally` block unconditionally unlinked
 * the file. After a stale-break, a process whose heartbeat missed the
 * staleMs window could have its lock re-acquired by a second holder;
 * the first holder's release would then delete the *second* holder's
 * live lock and admit a third. The release checks a random ownership
 * token; the heartbeat must also stay bound to the acquired file.
