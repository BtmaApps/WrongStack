/**
 * Who signed a thinking block — and keeping blocks away from a service that
 * would reject them.
 *
 * Every Anthropic-compatible service returns `thinking` blocks with a
 * `signature`, and the Messages contract replays them verbatim on the next
 * turn. The signatures are not interchangeable: Anthropic's are cryptographic
 * and verified (a foreign one is a 400 "Invalid `signature` in `thinking`
 * block"), Z.AI's are 24-hex-char record ids it does not verify (a fake one is
 * accepted — checked live 2026-09-30). A session that ran on Z.AI or MiniMax
 * and then switches, or falls back, to Claude used to replay the other
 * service's signatures to Anthropic and fail the turn.
 *
 * The official ZCode client handles this in two layers
 * (`reasoning-history-normalization.ts`): it strips reasoning produced by a
 * different provider before sending, and on a signature rejection it removes
 * the signed blocks and retries once. This module is the same for every
 * Anthropic-wire transport:
 *
 * 1. **Stamp** — the signer is recorded on the block (`providerMeta`) as the
 *    signature arrives, so provenance survives the session journal.
 * 2. **Filter** — before a request, blocks stamped by another signer are
 *    dropped. Anthropic additionally never accepts an unsigned `thinking`
 *    block (reasoning carried over from a Chat Completions provider), so
 *    those go too when the target is Anthropic.
 * 3. **Repair** — a signature rejection that still gets through (a block from
 *    before stamping existed) is retried once with every signed block removed.
