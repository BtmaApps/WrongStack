/**
 * OAuthRefreshCoordinator — shared refresh state + single-flight machinery
 * for OAuth providers.
 *
 * All three OAuth providers in this package (`openai-codex`, `anthropic-oauth`,
 * `github-copilot`) implemented the same pattern by hand:
 *   1. Hold a refresh token, expiry, and `refreshFn` callable
 *   2. Wrap the refresh call in `createSingleFlightRefresh` so concurrent
 *      requests share one upstream call + one persistence callback
 *   3. Re-check the expiry before each request, refresh on 401
 *
 * The refresh-token storage LOCATION differs (Codex rotates its refresh
 * token on every refresh; Anthropic + Copilot do not), and the `onRefresh`
 * payload shape differs (Codex includes `accountId`), so this is a
 * composition helper, not a base class — each provider wires it up with
 * two callbacks that describe the host-specific pieces.
 *
 * Why composition instead of inheritance: the three providers extend
 * different base classes (`WireAdapter` for codex, `WireFormatProvider`
 * for the other two), so a shared base class would compete with
 * existing inheritance. Composition also keeps each provider's token
 * fields (`this.access`, `this.refresh`, `this.expiresAt`, …) where the
 * build headers/body methods can read them directly — moving the state
 * into a mixin would force every read site to go through getters.
 */

/**
 * Process-wide refresh sharing, keyed by `label + refresh key`.
 *
 * Every provider build (leader, each subagent, every fallback hop, `/model`
 * switch, proxy or credential hot-reload) constructs its own coordinator from
 * the same stored credentials, so several live instances hold the SAME refresh
 * token. The per-instance single-flight below cannot see its siblings: at
 * expiry each one exchanged that token on its own. Codex and Claude rotate the
 * refresh token on use, so every exchange after the first failed with
 * `invalid_grant` — and a sibling built later from the not-yet-reloaded config
 * replayed the already-rotated token the same way. Those agents died on a
 * non-retryable auth error until the user signed in again.
 *
 * - `inFlight`: concurrent exchanges of one token share a single request.
 * - `rotations`: once a token has been exchanged, a later holder of the old
 *   token follows the chain to the tokens it produced instead of replaying it.
 *   Entries live until the access token they carry expires (bounded count).
