/**
 * Connection warm-up for provider endpoints (`Provider.warm`).
 *
 * A request to an endpoint nobody has talked to lately pays for a DNS lookup,
 * a TCP handshake and a full TLS handshake before its first byte goes out.
 * Hosts call `warm()` while the user is still typing; a cheap `GET /` to the
 * endpoint's origin does that work early, and the real request takes the
 * open socket from fetch's keep-alive pool (checked against api.z.ai,
 * api.anthropic.com and api.openai.com: one connection for both requests).
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-23 (time to response headers, median of 6, cold vs warmed):
 * api.z.ai 242 → 164 ms, and the ~900 ms cold-DNS outliers (2 of 6) were gone;
 * api.anthropic.com 179 → 159 ms; api.openai.com, a nearby CDN edge, no change.
 *
 * GET, not HEAD: undici does not pool a socket after a HEAD response. The
 * body of an API origin's root is a short error page; it is read to the end
 * (cancelling a body destroys its socket) up to a cap.
 *
 * The pool drops an idle socket after about 4 s unless the server asks for
 * longer, so calls are throttled per origin rather than de-duplicated: a user
 * typing for a minute costs one small request every few seconds.
