/**
 * Antigravity quota reporter — `POST /v1internal:retrieveUserQuota`.
 *
 * Antigravity meters per model, not per account: each Gemini variant has its
 * own bucket with its own reset. Nothing about that is reported on an
 * inference response — not in headers, not in the stream — so like Copilot
 * this reporter has to ask, and unlike Copilot it has to ask the *same* host
 * that serves inference.
 *
 * That makes the call ordering the interesting part. Asking costs a request to
 * a metered host, so it is bound to a moment that has already earned one: the
 * reporter runs after a completed turn, not before, and never on the path of
 * the turn itself.
 *
 * Response shape:
 *
 *   { buckets: [ { modelId, remainingFraction, resetTime } ] }
 *
 * `remainingFraction` is a 0..1 **remaining** fraction — the inverse of every
 * other provider's "used percent" — and its absence is meaningful: it means
 * the backend did not report, which is not the same as 0% left. A 429 carries
 * no bucket at all; its reset arrives as `quotaResetDelay` in the error body.
 *
