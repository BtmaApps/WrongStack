 * The catalog publishes TWO windows and they mean different things:
 *
 * - `context_window` is the model's DEFAULT window (272K across the current
 *   lineup, 128K on spark).
 * - `max_context_window` is the largest window the model supports — the
 *   ceiling an explicit configured override may reach. The official client
 *   resolves it as `configured.min(max_context_window)`
 *   (codex-rs/models-manager/src/model_info.rs, `with_config_overrides`).
 *
 * So `max_context_window` IS a bigger window, just one a client has to ask
 * for; on gpt-6-astra and the gpt-5.6 family it is 872K against a 272K
 * default. Reporting the default as a hard cap throws away two thirds of the
 * window these models actually have, which is why the maximum is preferred
 * here and the default is only the fallback for older catalogs. The agent loop
 * still clamps this against its own configured baseline and any learned
 * overflow limit, so this is a ceiling, not a target.
 *
 * The effective percent is the output/overhead reserve the backend keeps
 * inside whichever window applies; there is no separate fixed subtraction to
 * make on top of it.
