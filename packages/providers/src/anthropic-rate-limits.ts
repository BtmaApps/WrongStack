/**
 * Anthropic quota reporter — the `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` headers.
 *
 * A Claude Pro/Max login is metered on rolling windows (a 5-hour one and a
 * 7-day one) rather than per token, and the only place that budget is reported
 * is a header family on every `/v1/messages` response. Nothing about it reaches
 * the SSE body, so a transport that only reads the body cannot tell the user
 * how much of their plan they have burned; they find out when a 429 lands
 * mid-turn.
 *
 * This module is the Anthropic-specific HALF, exactly as
 * `openai-codex-rate-limits` is for Codex: it knows the header names and
 * nothing else. The shape it produces and the store it writes to are
 * provider-neutral (`@wrongstack/core/quota`), so the statusline chip, the
 * quota report, and the WebUI panel render it without learning that Anthropic
 * exists.
 *
 * Header family:
 *
 *   anthropic-ratelimit-unified-5h-utilization      fraction 0..1 (see below)
 *   anthropic-ratelimit-unified-5h-reset            epoch SECONDS
 *   anthropic-ratelimit-unified-5h-status           per-window state
 *   anthropic-ratelimit-unified-7d-utilization      same pair for the long window
 *   anthropic-ratelimit-unified-7d-reset
 *   anthropic-ratelimit-unified-7d-status
 *   anthropic-ratelimit-unified-status              account-wide state
 *   anthropic-ratelimit-unified-representative-claim  which window is binding
 *
 * Two deliberate exclusions:
 *
 * 1. **The per-minute buckets** (`anthropic-ratelimit-requests-remaining`,
 *    `-tokens-remaining`, `-input-tokens-*`, `-output-tokens-*`) are NOT read
 *    here. They are the API-key tier's per-minute throughput allowance, not a
 *    subscription budget: they refill every minute, and a burst that takes one
 *    to 95% is normal operation. Feeding them into the same store would let a
 *    momentary throughput spike win `worstProviderQuotaWindow()` and render as
 *    "your plan is nearly gone" in the status bar. Throughput backpressure
 *    belongs to the retry/backoff path, which already reads `retry-after`.
 *
 * 2. **`GET /api/oauth/usage`** — the endpoint that backs Claude Code's own
 *    usage view — is not polled. It is undocumented, requires the `user:profile`
 *    scope (a `setup-token` credential gets a 403), rate-limits per access token
 *    rather than per account, and hands out permanent 429s to callers that do
 *    not send a `claude-code/<version>` user agent. The header path rides along
 *    on requests we are already making, costs nothing, and cannot be throttled
 *    separately.
