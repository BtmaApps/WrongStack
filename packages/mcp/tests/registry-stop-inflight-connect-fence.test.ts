/**
 * Characterization: the post-connect guard in attemptConnectSlot
 * (registry-connect-loop.ts, the `slot.state === 'disconnected'` check right
 * after `await client.connect()`) fences the LAST stop()/wake race window —
 * a demand-wake whose transport connect is still in flight (has not yet
 * assigned slot.client) when stop() resolves.
 *
 * Round 27 made stop() drain until the slot is empty, which closes every
 * window where a wake has already ASSIGNED. The remaining window — connect
 * parked pre-assignment — is only safe because of that guard: stop()
 * unconditionally leaves state='disconnected', and when the parked connect
 * later resolves, the guard sees it and tears the fresh client down without
 * assigning (no orphan transport, no resurrect-after-stop). Removing or
 * "simplifying" the guard would silently reopen the leak, so this suite pins
 * exactly that behavior.
 *
 * Harness: the REAL wake path runs end to end (ensureConnected →
 * singleFlightConnect → attemptConnect → attemptConnectSlot constructs a real
 * MCPClient); only the transport boundary is gated —
 * MCPClient.prototype.connect parks on a gate before the assignment, and
 * close/listTools/getServerMetadata are stubbed at the same boundary. The
 * control proves the harness would observe a resurrect if one occurred.
