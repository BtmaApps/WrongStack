/**
 * Shared core of the `ClientTransport` double used by the client-side suites.
 *
 * `acp-session.test.ts` and `security-hardening.test.ts` each install a
 * `vi.mock` factory for `src/agent/stdio-transport.js`. Only the members below
 * were byte-identical between them; each suite keeps its own `respond`
 * (acp-session echoes `method` and also has `respondError`, security-hardening
 * omits both), so the diverging parts deliberately stay at the call site.
 *
 * A suite must load this with a DYNAMIC import from inside its `vi.mock`
 * factory, not a static top-level import: vitest hoists `vi.mock` above the
 * imports, so a statically-imported binding is not yet initialised when the
 * factory body runs.
