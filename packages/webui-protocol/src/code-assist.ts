/**
 * Code Assist — the shared contract for the "Ask AI" panel mounted on the
 * File Manager and Code Atlas screens.
 *
 * A run is deliberately EPHEMERAL: it is answered by a throwaway isolated
 * agent on the server (see the `makeLightSubagentFactory` pattern) rather than
 * by a `session.new` session. That distinction is the whole point of this
 * module — `session.new` re-points the runtime's foreground session and
 * persists a row the user then has to clean up, neither of which a small
 * side-panel analysis should ever do.
 *
 * The preset vocabulary lives here (not in either surface) so the WebUI's
 * button labels and the server's prompt templates cannot drift apart.
