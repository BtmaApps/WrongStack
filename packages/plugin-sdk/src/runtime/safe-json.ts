/**
 * @wrongstack/plugins — serialisation that cannot take the process down.
 *
 * Plugins routinely stringify values they did not construct: event-bus
 * payloads, tool results, mailbox bodies. `JSON.stringify` throws on a
 * circular reference and on `BigInt`, and several of these call sites sit
 * inside detached (fire-and-forget) work where a throw becomes an
 * unhandled rejection rather than a handled failure.
 *
 * `safeJsonStringify` never throws. A value it cannot represent is
 * replaced with a marker, so the surrounding feature degrades to "this
 * field is unreadable" instead of failing — or crashing — outright.
