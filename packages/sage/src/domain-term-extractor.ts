/**
 * SAGE-based automatic domain-glossary engine.
 *
 * Detects project-specific terminology from agent<->user conversations and
 * from git commits, and keeps a `<projectRoot>/.wrongstack/domain-terms.md`
 * mirror for human readability.
 *
 * Memory persistence is intentionally disabled
 * --------------------------------------------
 * The extractor used to persist each term as a regular `Sage` memory with
 * `tags: ['domain-term', 'glossary', 'project-jargon']`. That tagging
 * polluted the SAGE corpus with entries that were indistinguishable from
 * genuine project facts in search and triage. Persisting is now a
 * no-op: `persistVia` returns a `skipped` report for every term, and the
 * file mirror is regenerated from the in-memory `ExtractedTerm[]` of
 * the current pass rather than from SAGE state.
 *
 * What still runs:
 *
 *   - `extractFromConversation` / `extractFromCommits` — heuristic
 *     detection of project jargon from text.
 *   - `writeDomainTermsFile(projectRoot, terms)` — writes the
 *     `.wrongstack/domain-terms.md` mirror from the in-memory terms.
 *   - `persistViaAndMirror` — chains the no-op `persistVia` with the
 *     file mirror write so call sites that previously persisted
 *     terms and refreshed the mirror keep the same control flow.
 *
 * The lookup tags `domain-term` / `glossary` / `project-jargon` are
 * preserved as exported constants (see {@link DOMAIN_TERM_LOOKUP_TAG})
 * so the one-off `/memory purge-domain-terms` migration can still
 * identify and remove any historical entries that were tagged before
 * this change. New entries are never written.
 *
 * The system prompt glossary (`renderDomainGlossary` in
 * `packages/core/src/core/system-prompt-glossary.ts`) will now return
 * an empty string by construction, because no live SAGE memory will
 * carry the `domain-term` tag once the migration runs. The function
 * itself is left intact — hosts that still wire it continue to
 * receive a clean empty result, not a runtime error.
 *
 * Architectural rules respected here:
 *
 *   1. In-process consumers reach SAGE through `ProjectSageMemoryPort`
 *      (direct IPC over the per-project socket). The MCP layer is
 *      reserved for external consumers. See
 *      `../../docs/direct-icp-usage.md` for the contract.
 *   2. The file mirror (`.wrongstack/domain-terms.md`) is **derived
 *      state** regenerated from in-memory terms on every extraction
 *      pass. Deleting the file does not lose data — the next
 *      extraction overwrites it.
 *   3. The mirror is bounded by the per-call cap and a per-entry char
 *      cap (default 96 chars). The prompt goal is precision over
 *      recall: a 6-line dictionary the model actually reads beats a
 *      200-term dump it ignores.
 *
 * Heuristic detection rules (deliberately conservative — false positives
 * pollute the mirror):
 *
 *   - **PascalCase / camelCase identifiers** (e.g. `SddBoardProjector`,
 *     `TaskGraph`) — must contain at least 4 characters and start with an
 *     uppercase or lowercase ASCII letter.
 *   - **Multi-word proper names** (e.g. `Mailbox Bridge`, `Project Root`)
 *     — a sequence of capitalized words that the conversation treats as a
 *     single noun phrase (the first mention usually looks like
 *     "`the **Mailbox Bridge** owns the socket`").
 *   - **Kebab-case / slash-case identifiers** that already appear as code
 *     symbols (e.g. `domain-terms.md`, `./wrongstack/domain-terms.md`)
 *     are recognized via git paths and short-circuited to file references.
 *
 *   **Common English words are blocked from the dictionary via a tiny
 *   stop-list baked into {@link COMMON_WORD_STOPLIST}.** Adding to it is
 *   cheaper than fighting an over-eager regex.
 *
 *   Detection NEVER fires for explicit user phrasing such as
 *   "I mean the Mailbox Bridge component". Those phrases are normal
 *   sentences; we treat the *subject* of such sentences as a term
 *   candidate rather than the entire sentence.
