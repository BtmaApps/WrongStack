/**
 * System One front for triage Phases 3 and 4.
 *
 * Both phases ask a chat model for a label and read it back with a regex:
 * Phase 3 a 1-5 value rating ("SCORE | reason", first digit wins), Phase 4 a
 * YES / NO / OVERLAP merge verdict. Both answers are points on an ordered,
 * closed scale — a TypeSafe `Score` — and both run hundreds of times per
 * `/memory triage`, where Jev's per-input-token price and latency matter.
 *
 * This is a cascade, not a replacement: a judgment returns `undefined`
 * whenever it is not concentrated enough to act on, or the host is resting,
 * or the call fails, and the caller then asks the LLM exactly as before. The
 * rating the LLM would have produced is never overridden by a weak judgment.
