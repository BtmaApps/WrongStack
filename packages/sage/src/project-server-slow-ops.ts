 * Build the daemon's slow-operation reporter. `stats` supplies the queue depth
 * and client count named in the report line. A dispatch slower than the
 * threshold is reported on stderr.
 *
 * SQLite is synchronous and this daemon runs one event loop, so a slow
 * operation is never slow for its caller alone — every other client of the
 * project waits behind it, and a queue deep enough makes them fail with their
 * own 30s call timeout somewhere else entirely. That is how an FTS join-order
 * regression (seconds per `searchSage` under one SQLite build, milliseconds
 * under another) stayed invisible until unrelated ops started timing out. One
 * throttled line names the op and the queue depth instead.
 *
 * `WRONGSTACK_SAGE_SLOW_OP_MS` overrides the threshold; 0 reports every
 * request, which is what the lifecycle test asserts against. The threshold is
 * read when the reporter is built (daemon start), as before.
