/**
 * Contrast floors for the shipped palette set.
 *
 * These are NOT aspirational numbers — they were measured across all 64
 * presets before being written down, and each is set at (or just under) the
 * real floor of the catalogue so the test catches a REGRESSION in a palette,
 * not a stylistic disagreement with it.
 *
 * Measured distribution (n = 64 for every pair):
 *
 *   textPrimary  on surface      min 7.22  (one-dark)        median 11.86
 *   textSecondary on surface     min 5.12  (everforest)      median  8.42
 *   textMuted    on surface      min 3.03  (rose-pine-moon) median  4.19
 *   success      on diffAddBg    min 2.48  (rose-pine)      median  6.64
 *   error        on diffDelBg    min 3.00  (sandstone)      median  4.52
 *
 * `success on diffAddBg` is now held to the full 3.0. `rose-pine` used to be a
 * documented exception at 2.4: its green was pine `#31748f`, dark enough that
 * no add-wash still reading as a tinted row could clear 3:1. That is the
 * recorded "dark marker on a near-black base" trap, and the fix belongs in the
 * MARKER, not the wash — `success` is now `#3e8fb0` (the pine-teal
 * `rose-pine-moon` already ships in that family), measuring 3.55:1 on the same
 * `#1f3538` wash, with the comment-on-wash ratio and wash luminance unchanged.
 * `textMuted` is held to 3.0 instead of the 4.5 body-text rule because it is
 * a deliberately de-emphasised token, not body copy.
