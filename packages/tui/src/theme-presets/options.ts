 * `/theme` command reads too. This file used to hand-write a 64-row literal
 * that duplicated the CLI's own table, so a reworded or renamed preset could
 * drift between the two pickers with nothing failing to compile — only the
 * id set was ever linked.
 *
 * Deriving from the shared record also means the family grouping the picker
 * renders and the CLI's list are guaranteed to describe the same presets.

  // makes the grouping usable: the reducer, the Enter handler and the rendered
  // window all index into THIS array, so reordering it in one place keeps
  // `selected` meaning the same thing everywhere.
  //
  // `Array.prototype.sort` is stable, so sorting only on `family` preserves
  // canonical order inside each group without a second comparison.
