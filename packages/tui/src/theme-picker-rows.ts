/**
 * Pure selection/windowing logic behind the `/theme` picker.
 *
 * The picker used to window a flat list of 64 rows. Three additions made that
 * arithmetic wrong on its own:
 *
 *   - **Filtering.** Type-to-filter narrows the list, so the focused index is
 *     an index into the FILTERED list, not the full catalogue.
 *   - **Family grouping.** Headers are real rows now, and they differ in cost
 *     from option rows — a uniform `rowSpan` can no longer describe the list.
 *   - **The row budget.** `maxRows` is a hard contract the existing tests
 *     assert; adding header rows must not silently overflow it.
 *
 * So the picker now operates on a *row model* (headers + options interleaved)
 * and windows over rows rather than over option indices. Everything here is a
 * pure function of its arguments — no React, no Ink, no `useTerminalSize` — so
 * the budget and windowing rules are unit-testable without rendering a frame.
