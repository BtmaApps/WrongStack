# Release Process

WrongStack ships only through GitHub Releases. Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag makes
`.github/workflows/release.yml` build the GitHub Release (standalone binaries,
installers, checksums and Desktop packages); that is the whole release.

## npm is retired

npm publishing is retired for good. Every workspace package is
`"private": true`, so `npm publish` / `bun publish` refuse in any package
directory; the root `prepublishOnly` hook fails with an explanation; the npm
publish scripts are deleted; and no workflow publishes to or reads from the
registry. The versions already on npm stay frozen as they are (no deprecation,
no unpublish). `bun run release` is an alias for `bun run release:check` and
publishes nothing.

## The tag (GitHub Release)

After `bun run release:check` passes on the committed release candidate and
`main` is pushed, push an annotated tag matching the root manifest version (the
full checklist is in [release.md](release.md)):

```bash
git tag -a v<version> -m '<version>' && git push origin v<version>
```

A `verify` job proves the tag matches `package.json` and is an ancestor of
`origin/main`, and pins that SHA. Every later job checks out the pinned SHA, so
a moved tag cannot change what is built.

## Standalone binaries (the primary distribution)

The same tag also builds one self-contained executable per platform — Bun
runtime, CLI, every project daemon, all surfaces and the package assets in a
single file — and publishes them as GitHub release assets. The
`github-release` job depends on the tag checks (`verify`) and the
binary jobs only. The full `release:check` runs as the separate `gate` job,
which nothing waits on — an unrelated red suite cannot hold a binary release
back, while every shipped binary still has to pass the cross-platform smoke.

| Job | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `binaries` | `bun scripts/build-binaries.mjs` cross-compiles all targets on one Ubuntu runner, then `bun scripts/smoke-binary.mjs` runs the Linux x64 build |
| `binaries-smoke` | runs the same smoke on real Windows x64, Windows arm64 and macOS (arm64) runners |
| `github-release` | verifies manifest coverage and digests, then uploads `wstack-*`, `SHA256SUMS`, `install.sh`, `install.ps1` |
| `desktop` | packages and smokes Windows, Linux, macOS arm64, and macOS x64 through the reusable Desktop workflow |
| `publish-desktop` | merges and verifies package-owned checksum manifests, then attaches Desktop assets to the GitHub Release |
| `gate` | runs the full `release:check` as an independent signal; nothing waits on it |

Asset upload jobs resolve the release ID through `gh release view`, which
supports both drafts and published releases. A pre-existing draft stays a
draft while verified assets are attached; publish it after reviewing the
completed uploads. Reruns compare asset names and SHA-256 digests and skip
uploads that already match.

Targets: `windows-x64`, `windows-arm64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`,
`linux-x64-musl`, `linux-arm64-musl`, `darwin-x64`, `darwin-arm64`.

Build and smoke locally (Bun required):

```bash
bun run build:binary                     # this machine's target only
bun scripts/smoke-binary.mjs            # smoke it
bun run build:binaries                   # every target → dist-bin/
```

How the binary differs from a source/workspace install at runtime — daemon dispatch,
project-script dispatch, the extracted asset tree, "am I main" guards — is
documented once in `packages/persistence/src/standalone-binary.ts`; the entry
that implements it is `scripts/binary/entry.mjs`. Two rules for new code:

- **Dynamic imports must use literal specifiers.** `import(variable)` is
  invisible to the bundler and silently missing from the binary.
- **Locate package files through the helpers** (`moduleDirFor`,
  `wrongstackPackageJsonPath`, `daemonSpawnArgs`, `cliSpawnArgs`,
  `scriptSpawnArgs`), never through `import.meta.url` or `process.argv[1]`
  directly. A new runtime asset directory also goes into `ASSETS` in
  `scripts/build-binaries.mjs`.

## Full gate — `release:check`

A broad correctness sweep run on the release commit before the tag is pushed:

```bash
bun run release:check
# ↪ bun scripts/audit-dependencies.mjs --audit-level=moderate
#   bun run build
#   bun scripts/check-tools-package-smoke.mjs
#   bun run check:dist-hidden
#   bun run providers:catalog:check
#   bun run website:tools:check
#   bun run plugins:manifest:check
#   bun scripts/check-package-contracts.mjs
#   bun run write:build-manifest
#   bun run check:build-manifest
#   bun run check:architecture
#   bun run check:test-inventory
#   bun run check:test-skips
#   bun run check:node-pty
#   bun run check:rulebook
#   bun run lint:i18n
#   bun run typecheck:only
#   bun run check:test-types
#   bun run test:coverage
```

The matrix is defined in `scripts/release-check-matrix.mjs`. Its release profile
has 19 gates, including the packed tools-package smoke, catalog/projection freshness,
architecture, test inventory/skips/types, build lineage and coverage ratchets.
Full `bun run lint` and browser smoke are separate. `ci:local` and `release:fast`
use different profiles; neither is the full release profile.

Coverage executes its configured test areas; a failed or skipped prerequisite
prevents certification. Report a full pass only after the final process exits 0
with `0 failed · 0 skipped · 19 passed`. Per-gate evidence is written under
`.reports/release-check-matrix/`. Focused tests or old logs do not certify the
current checkout.

## Narrow plugin guard — `test:guard`

`test:guard` runs three focused plugin tests. It is an explicit command only:
the root `prepublishOnly` hook no longer runs it — that hook now always fails,
because nothing in this repository may be published to npm. The full
`bun run release:check` remains the actual repository-wide gate.

```bash
bun run test:guard
# ↪ bun --bun run vitest run packages/plugins/tests/catalog.test.ts
#                            packages/plugins/tests/plugin-teardown.test.ts
#                            packages/plugins/tests/smoke.test.ts
```

**What it guards**:

| File | Why it matters |
|------|-----------------|
| `packages/plugins/tests/catalog.test.ts` | The plugin catalog must list every plugin exported from `src/index.ts`. A mismatch means `spec-linker` (or any other consumer) will be stale on day one. |
| `packages/plugins/tests/plugin-teardown.test.ts` | Lifecycle expectations are checked per plugin — the teardown of each plugin that owns timers, watchers or stores. |
| `packages/plugins/tests/smoke.test.ts` | All 8 historic plugin files (the original 8 from the pre-catalog era) must still import and register. Catches broken barrel exports. |

**Why a separate script?** It gives maintainers focused feedback on catalog,
lifecycle, and barrel regressions. Avoid fixed timing claims: duration varies by
machine and the full suite is much larger than this three-file selection.

## When each layer runs

| Command | What runs |
|---------|-----------|
| `bun run release` | Alias for `release:check`; publishes nothing |
| `bun run release:check` | Full repository release gate, no publication |
| `bun run test:guard` | Three focused plugin tests only |
| `prepublishOnly` (root) | Always fails: npm publishing is retired |
| `bun run test` | Root Vitest suite, then the WebUI package test script |
| Tag push (`v*.*.*`) | Verify the tag/SHA; build and smoke standalone plus Desktop assets; create the GitHub Release |
| Manual `CI` dispatch (`ci.yml`) | Run the repository CI jobs on the selected ref; pushes and pull requests do not start them |
| Manual `Dependency Audit` dispatch (`audit.yml`) | Run the configured dependency audit; there is no scheduled or push trigger |
| Manual `Deploy Website` dispatch (`pages.yml`) | Validate/build the website and deploy the selected ref to Pages |

Since 1.0.34, CI, dependency audit and Pages deployment use
`workflow_dispatch` only. Publishing a commit does not start those checks or
deploy the website. Dispatch them for the reviewed ref and inspect their final
results separately from the tag-triggered release workflow. Updating README,
changelog and website content prepares those surfaces; it does not establish
a GitHub release or a live deployment.

## Adding a new guard

When the catalog grows (e.g. a new invariants test, a new
contract test) the guard list in `package.json` should be
extended:

```jsonc
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:guard": "bun --bun run vitest run packages/plugins/tests/catalog.test.ts packages/plugins/tests/plugin-teardown.test.ts packages/plugins/tests/smoke.test.ts packages/plugins/tests/<new-guard>.test.ts"
  }
}
```

The pattern: a guard test is **fast** (sub-second each), **specific**
(catches one well-defined class of regression), and **independent**
(doesn't depend on the plugin lifecycle state). The three
existing guards — catalog, H1 teardown, smoke — are the
baseline; new ones should match the same shape.

> The H1 teardown test enumerates every entry in
> `packages/plugins/src/catalog.ts`. The catalog itself enforces
> kebab-case names + uniqueness at module load, so any future plugin
> added to the index must also be added to the catalog — the
> `plugin-teardown.test.ts` guard catches a drift between the two.

## Why keep the focused guard

| Concern | `release:check` | `test:guard` |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| Type/build/audit/package-contract/i18n failures | ✅ | ❌ |
| Full test suite | ✅ | ❌ |
| Focused catalog/lifecycle/barrel feedback | Covered by full tests | ✅ |
